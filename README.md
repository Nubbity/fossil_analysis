# Data Analysis with Python: 2024-2025

This repository contains my project submission for the [Data Analysis with Python](https://courses.mooc.fi/org/uh-cs/courses/data-analysis-with-python-2024-2025) course offered by the University of Helsinki. This course dives into the fundamentals of data analysis, equipping students with practical skills in Python for handling, analyzing, and visualizing data.

## Course Overview

The **Data Analysis with Python** course is designed to teach students essential skills in data science, focusing on real-world data analysis tasks using Python and its popular libraries. Through a series of hands-on exercises and projects, students learn to apply Python to data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis. By the end of the course, students are able to:
- Understand and apply the data analysis workflow in Python
- Perform data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory analysis
- Visualize data to gain insights and present findings effectively
- Conduct basic statistical analyses and interpret results

**Key Libraries Covered:**
- **Pandas** - for data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy** - for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** - for data visualization
- **Scipy** - for statistical analysis
- **Scikit-learn** - for basic machine learning tasks

## Project: Fossil Record Analysis

For the course's final project, I completed an analysis of a fossil dataset, following a structured approach to explore, visualize, and interpret historical data about fossil discoveries. The objective was to analyze fossil records, identify patterns, and make sense of historical trends in fossil findings.

### Project Objectives and Learning Outcomes

In completing the project, I have gained experience in:
- Cleaning and preparing complex datasets for analysis
- Visualizing trends in time-series and categorical data
- Conducting statistical analyses to draw meaningful conclusions
- Interpreting findings in the context of scientific research questions

### Project Highlights
The project involved:
1. **Data Preparation** - Loading and cleaning fossil data to handle missing values and categorical inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Using descriptive statistics and visualizations to uncover key trends and distributions within the fossil dataset.
3. **Visualization** - Creating insightful visualizations to represent the evolution of fossil records over time, types of fossil discoveries, and geographic distributions.
4. **Statistical Testing** - Applying hypothesis testing and other statistical techniques to validate patterns observed in the data.
